Before anything, **THANK YOU!** Somehow, you are here, and I appreciate the time you took to come and take a glance at my life! `r emo::ji("happy")`

My name is **Alejandro Rodrigo**. Through this website, you will be able to know me better. The goal is to share with you some of my [research](publications.html){target="_blank"}, [ongoing projects](projects.html){target="_blank"}, [work experience](work-experience.html){target="_blank"}, and [hobbies](under-construction.html){target="_blank"}. 

In here I'm allowing myself to share a small part of my history and background with you. I will show you both, my successes, and failures, those that kept me going throughout my life. So, come out with me and embark on a journey where I'm constantly rediscovering my personal, academic, and research motives.

I was born on November 8th, 1986, in the traditional territory of the Mēxihcah (Mexica), the capital of the iconic Aztec Empire formerly known as Tenochtitlan and currently recognize as [Mexico City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City){target="_blank"}. Mexico City is considered the most populous city in North America and is ranked as the [fifth most populated city in the world](https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities){target="_blank"}`r emo::ji("confounded")`, but most importantly, is the [taco capital of the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taco){target="_blank"}! `r emo::ji("delicious")`. 

I'm currently living in [Vancouver, British Columbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver){target="_blank"}. An astonishing city with a remarkable action plan to be considered ["the greenest city in the world"](https://vancouver.ca/files/cov/2021-greenest-city-action-plan-final-update.pdf){target="_blank"} and rated as one of the tops according to the “Green View Index” of [treepedia](http://senseable.mit.edu/treepedia){target="_blank"}. 

I'm proud to enjoy the simple pleasures life has to offer and observing animals is one of them. I'm deeply passionate about [animal life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal){target="_blank"} and its behavior. That is why I choose to make a professional career out of it! Research provided me with the tools to study how animals behave, but moreover what is their role in the environment they live in and how they can impact our daily lives. 

>I think [**CURIOSITY**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity){target="_blank"} is an essential part of my life as a researcher, but [**LOVE**](https://forms.gle/Piqo6bxWHEyCUYQk8){target="_blank"} motivates me to keep going. 

My current research interests include Animal Behavior and Cognition, Animal Well-Being and Environmental Enrichment, Computer Science, Data Management and Statistics, and Urban Ecology and Evolution. These days I'm exploring more about Spatial Navigation, Learning and Memory, Sensation and Perception, and Fish and Invertebrate Behavior.  

I decided to summarize my academic career below. Still, if you want to know more in detail, I invite you to click on the links scattered throughout the website. Please feel free to explore it! I hope you enjoy what I have prepared for you. Again, thanks for visiting!

## Founding Partner of Walden Modular Equipment (Ago 2017 – Sep 2018)

In collaboration with [Dr. Laurent Avila-Chauvet](http://lcsia.com/CVU.html){target="_blank"} and the [Walden Modular Equipment team](http://waldenme.com/team.html){target="_blank"}, we started the ["Armando Ciencia"](https://www.zapopan.gob.mx/egresan-79-proyectos-de-la-sexta-generacion-del-programa-reto-zapopan/) project. This project aimed to build laboratory equipment capable of studying behavior through quickly assembled modules. The equipment manufactured was comparable to "lego for scientists." With this idea, we won an invitation to participate in the 6th generation of [Reto Zapopan](https://www.retozapopan.com.mx/){target="_blank"} (a government agency that encourages innovative projects){target="_blank"}. By the end of 2018, the Armando Ciencia project evolved, and we found the company [Walden Modular Equipment](http://waldenme.com/index.html){target="_blank"}.

## Coordinator of the Animal Welfare Department at [Africam Safari](https://africamsafari.com/) (July 2011 – April 2013)

After graduating from veterinary sciences, I coordinated the animal welfare department at Africam Safari, paying particular attention to the environmental enrichment program. During this time, more than 45 species and approximately 120 individuals were involved with the program. One of the program's main objectives was to promote the development of cognitive skills through tasks related to problem-solving, and to increase typical species behaviors. Another essential activity of the department was coordinating the volunteer program, which included more than 30 undergraduate students from veterinary sciences, biology, and psychology. During this time, I was also head of the Animal Ambassador Program. This program was endorsed by the Conservation Education Department, and it included more than 18 different species.

**Main duties: **  
1) Coordination of undergraduate students and volunteers involved in the environmental enrichment program.  
2) Scheduling day-to-day activities of the program.  
3) Overseeing electronic documentation and reports on environmental enrichment and animal training
programs.  
4) Review of safety protocols based on institutional guidelines to provide and improve the well-being
of animals.  
5) Provision of expertise about the biology of species to media and zoo guests.
