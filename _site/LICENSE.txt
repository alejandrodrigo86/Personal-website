Some of the files are not finished so if there is a comment at the beginning of the code (such as: need update), be aware that some of those words needs to be reformulated by me. 
So please, please, please don't copy or take them as fact! There are simply ideas!  
If there are no notes, then that information is ready for use. 
So, as a cool person you are, if you have any questions or concernes or if you take any of the ideas in this website and you would love to collaborate, just shout! 
My email is alejandro.rgutierrez@alumnos.udg.mx
To all the people that maybe don't want to colaborate with me —it's cool!— I want to ask you as a personal favor to simply reference my website. 
I'm not going to be offended if you don't, but it is matter of principles and good values, and I believe all the good people in this world have it! 
Thanks for visiting!
Best, 
Alex R.
